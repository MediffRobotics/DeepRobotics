= Introduction =

The first version of the Python toolbox is out!  

The Python version shares much of the syntax of the Matlab version.  Linear algebra is handled using the [http://www.scipy.org/Documentation NumPy] library.  The NumPy matrix type is the default used, but most functions have been written to vector argument to be given as an array, matrix or a simple native list.  Python named arguments are used in preference to variable length unnamed argument lists.

The convention of the previous toolbox where arguments can be given separately or as a single matrix:
{{{
rne(robot, q, qd, qdd)
rne(robot, [q qd qdd])
}}}
is generally retained.

== Implementation ==

The code is aggregated into a few .py files along functional lines, ie. transform.py, quaternion.py.  All methods are brought into the global name space using 

{{{
from robot import *
}}}

which also imports NumPy.

All functions are documented with Python docstrings using the [http://epydoc.sourceforge.net epydoc] tool which gives similar features to Javadoc
and doxygen.

== Usage ==

{{{
>>> from robot import *
>>> quaternion( rotx(0.1) )
0.998750 <0.049979, 0.000000, 0.000000>
>>> roty(0.2)
matrix([[ 0.98006658,  0.        ,  0.19866933],
        [ 0.        ,  1.        ,  0.        ],
        [-0.19866933,  0.        ,  0.98006658]])
>>> 
}}}

== Getting the toolbox ==

The code and the HTML documentation are available as separate zip files from the 
[http://code.google.com/p/robotics-toolbox-python/downloads/list Download] tab.

You can browse the source via the Source tab.

== Other versions of the toolbox ==

  * The original [http://www.petercorke.com/Robotics%20Toolbox.html Matlab version]
  * A recent [http://rtss.sourceforge.net/docs/index.html Scilab version]
