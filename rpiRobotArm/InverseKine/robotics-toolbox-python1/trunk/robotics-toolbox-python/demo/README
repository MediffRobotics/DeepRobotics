Some tutorial/demos in increasing order of complexity.

transform.py    transforms and quaternions
trajectory.py   trajectories
fkine.py        forward kinematics
jacobian.py     Jacbians
ikine.py        inverse dynamics, RNE etc
idyn.py         inverse dynamics

To run them

  % python DEMO.py

they often pause with a 'more' prompt, to stop the text scrolling off
the screen.

These are command line apps, but could probably be spiffed up with a
wxPython interface.

----
fdyn.py         forward dynamics, not yet ported to Python
animation.py    animations, not yet ported to Python
